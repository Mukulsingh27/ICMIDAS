                        is an open, standards based technology platform that enables innovators to create apps that
                        seamlessly and securely run across the healthcare system. Using an electronic health record
                        system or data warehouse that supports the Smart Healthcare Technologies standard, patients,
                        doctors, and healthcare practitioners can draw on this library of apps to improve clinical care,
                        research, and public health. The Smart Healthcare Technologies platform is composed of open
                        standards, open source tools for developers building apps and a publicly accessible app gallery.
                        To make it easy for developers to get started building apps based on the Smart Healthcare
                        Technologies standards maintains and supports a set of open source libraries that simplify and
                        streamline the use of these standards in real world apps. Technical aspects of smart healthcare

                        With the advent of Wireless technology and Internet of Things (IoT) networking, enormous amount
                        of data is being generated which needs to be optimized using various learning and statistical
                        algorithms. Security and privacy of data has been a major concern from decades. However,
                        spontaneous growth of internet and the development of sophisticated methods have made this
                        concern even serious. Information security is of utmost importance for every business as data
                        is the most valuable commodity in today’s world. Issues related to data security in wireless
                        communication, IoT networking, infrastructure and private networks are severely critical in
                        today’s world and needs to be handled using robust and intelligent approach. This special
                        session will not only focus on recent trends and developments at globally competitive
                        environment but will also provide future directions to industry personnel’s and researchers.
                        It covers all aspects related to wireless communication, IoT networks, soft computing
                        techniques and machine learning. This special session welcomes unpublished research articles
                        from researchers in academia and industry such as students, engineers, research scholars and
                        scientists. </p>

                        Intelligence is defined as the ability to do or complete a task in any environment. 
						Therefore we can say that intelligence refers to the adaptability and capability based upon the goals to achieve.
						 Today, many systems are available which can mimic human, capable of decision making, can play games, perform image
						  or text recognition, control operations, understand speech etc. The basic idea of intelligence has been applied to
						   smart systems/robots and automation to increase the application of the same to a variety of problems. The area of
						    intelligent system & automation is becoming advance due to integration of various machine learning techniques. 
							Research in the area has been grown tremendously and outcome of the same is visible to all. The main aim of this
							 special session is to give platform to researchers to exchange the open dialogue and share their research progress
							  & contribution in the area. We are sure that the collaboration of researchers from different areas will get the
							   benefit of sharing the platform and new options of collaborative research will be open in future. </p>

                        Internet of Things (IOT) is a about extending the power of internet beyond the computing
						 devices and the smartphones to a range of other things, processes and environments. This 
						 connectivity shall help these devices to communicate with each other through processing and
						  analysis of data communicated between them. With each passing day, the number of objects 
						  and machines connected to the internet and transmitting information for analysis in increasing.
						   The objective therefore is to harness this data, discover trends and results that can provide
						    insights and opportunities for businesses to grow and reach greater heights. IoT and Big 
							Data evolved as independent technologies but over the years they have become interrelated
							 and their convergence has led to their best possible application across all spheres.

                        Data Science is the practice to acquire data, able to understand it, process it for 
						extraction of facts and information and communicate the facts in textual or visualize mode. 
						Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with 
						the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data. Data Science is different from 
						statistic and is mainly applied in generate decisions and predictions by making use of 
						predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics and machine learning. The focal theme 
						of this Special Session is to ventilate, present and discuss various research works on areas 
						of Data Science and its application in various real life problems.
